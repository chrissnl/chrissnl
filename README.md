### Welcome to my README 👋 

I'm Christina (some of my friends call me Chriss)! I'm a Program Manager at GitHub, working on accelerating customer growth and adoption via our **Executive Briefing (EBC)** program. I started here in Summer of 2022 and haven't unbuckled my seat belt yet.

<br> 

### Where I'm doing it 📌 
I currently live in the Greater Seattle Area and originate from the Washington DC area. Afer college (Go Hokies 🦃), I lived a stint in Dallas, TX and slowly kept making my way West. I love WA and can't see myself anywhere else!

<br> 

### How I got here 🚀
- My first post-grad role was at Microsoft as a Technical Support Engineer supporting customer IT leads directly and live debugging everything Exchange Server & Online 📬
- I spent the next couple of years learning new program management skillsets in the Chief of Staff office for Microsoft Worldwide Services, driving internal employee experience & inclusive communities. Managing the Circle of Excellence Award program was a career highlight because it was simply fun to see and recognize people for doing good work.
- In 2020, after a small break and at the height of the world moving online, I dove into this new remote world by supporting Microsoft Digital's customer engagement program as a contractor, connecting internal IT PMs to customers who desparately wanted to know how Microsoft approached their Digital Transformation. Customers wanted to learn and emulate how one of the largest, highly-matrixed companies adopted working remote globally. 
- This naturally led me to the 👑 of async work - GitHub! And the rest is still pen on paper ✍️ [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissnl/) with me to follow along!

### How I do my best work 👩🏻‍💻 
- I am a big proponent of block scheduling - you'll find my calendar filled with focus time ranging from task execution and brainstorming. Please respect the blocks noted as DND - the rest are fair game for scheduling!
- I follow an 80:20 method for async:live work. Working asynchronously allows both you and I to maximize our day. However, I enjoy talking through an idea or problem - and that's where the 20% comes in. Unless indicated otherwise, I welcome you to schedule 15-30 minutes for live collaboration.
- I am an INFJ - the Idealist. I am always seeking improvement, where things can be improved (even by 10%), and am driven by helping people/systems/process grow and become even better versions of themselves. 
- I thrive in an environment that has a "North Star" mission and where the journey is creative, collaborative and a ship to learn.
- I am a reserved personality - but I wouldn't say I'm shy! I am a listener and like to reflect, ask questions and get the big picture before jumping into something.
