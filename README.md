### Welcome to my README 👋 

I'm Christina (some of my friends call me Chriss)! I'm a Program Manager at GitHub, working on accelerating customer growth and adoption via our **Executive Briefing (EBC)** program. I started here in Summer of 2022 and haven't unbuckled my seat belt yet.

<br> 

### Where I'm doing it 📌 
I currently live in the Greater Seattle Area and originate from the Washington DC area. Afer college (Go Hokies 🦃), I lived a stint in Dallas, TX and slowly kept making my way West. I love WA and can't see myself anywhere else!

<br> 

### How I got here 🚀
- My first role at Microsoft was supporting Exchange Server and eventually a newer, rising service called Microsoft Azure 😳
- A couple of years in, I tried something new, supporting the Chief of Staff for the Microsoft Services org and driving their internal employee experience & community - managing the Circle of Excellence Award program was one of my favorite projects.
- In 2020, at the height of the world moving online, I moved into MSIT (later rebranded to Microsoft Digital) where I supported their customer engagement program, connecting our internal SMEs to customers who wanted to know how "Microsoft did it" -- "it" being our Digital Transformation from a largely in-person, connected company to working online, at home and at times, async.
- This naturally led me to the 👑 of async work - GitHub! And the rest is still in writing ✍️ I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissnl/) if you want to follow along!

### How I do my best work 👩🏻‍💻 
- I am a big proponent of block scheduling and you'll find my most of my calendar filled with focus time and tasks.
- I follow an 80:20 method for async:live work. Working asynchronously allow both you and I to maximize our day, however I enjoy talking things out and bouncing ideas around - and that's where the 20% comes in. Unless indicated otherwise, I welcome you to schedule 10-15 minutes for live collaboration.
- I am an INFJ - a character that says I'm an Idealist. I am constantly wanting to make things better, improve where things can be improved (even by 10%), and driven by helping others grow and become better versions of themselves.
